# Barcode-Counting

These scripts use a barcode:variant dictionary (created by the Barcode-Association programs) to determine the fitness scores of variants in deep mutational scanning experiments.

fitness_scores.py calculates functional scores from outgrowth experiments, using changes in variant frequency over time
abundance_scores.py calculates functional scores from sorting experiments, using ratios between populations

Usage is specified in the program headers
